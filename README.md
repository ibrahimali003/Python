# Python Basics for Data Analysis and Development

Welcome to my Python repository! This space contains practice projects and notes based on my Python lessons. Here, you'll find examples of core Python concepts essential for data analysis and general development.

This repository demonstrates my growing proficiency in Python through organised projects and examples. Feel free to explore the code, test the examples, and reach out if you have any questions.

## üìö Key Concepts Covered

### 1. Data Types & Variables
- **Strings, Integers, Floats, Booleans, Lists, Tuples, Sets, and Dictionaries**.
- Understanding the differences between mutable and immutable data types.
- Example: String slicing, operations on lists, and creating dictionaries.

### 2. Lists, Tuples, and Sets
- Manipulating **lists** (adding, removing, slicing, sorting).
- Working with **tuples** (immutable lists) and **sets** (unique unordered collections).
- Using built-in methods like `append()`, `sort()`, `intersection()`, and `union()`.

### 3. Dictionaries
- **Key-Value Pairs** and how to access, update, and remove items in dictionaries.
- Practical examples such as creating student databases and updating information.

### 4. Conditionals and Loops
- **If, Else, and Elif Statements** for decision-making.
- Using **for** and **while loops** to iterate over data structures.
- Practical use of logical operators `and`, `or`, and `not` in conditions.

### 5. Functions and Methods
- Defining reusable **functions** to perform tasks.
- Exploring methods for strings, lists, and other data types like `.upper()`, `.count()`, `.replace()`.

## üßë‚Äçüíª Example Notebooks
Each folder in this repository contains a **Jupyter Notebook** (`.ipynb`) where you can interactively explore Python code and see the outputs.

- [Data Types and Variables](./data_types_and_variables/data_types_and_variables.ipynb)
- [Lists, Tuples, and Sets](./lists_tuples_sets/lists_tuples_sets.ipynb)
- [Dictionaries](./dictionaries/dictionaries.ipynb)
- [Conditionals and Loops](./conditionals_and_loops/conditionals_and_loops.ipynb)
- [Functions and Methods](./functions_methods/functions_methods.ipynb)

Feel free to clone this repository and run the notebooks locally to get hands-on with each topic.
